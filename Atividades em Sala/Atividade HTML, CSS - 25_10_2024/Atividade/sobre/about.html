        <h1>History of NASA</h1>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="item1"> <h1>Fundation</h1> <p>
                NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) was founded on July 29, 1958, in response to the growing space race between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly after the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957. The creation of the agency was part of a strategy to ensure U.S. leadership in space exploration, science, and technology.<p>
                
                <p>The president who approved the establishment of NASA was Dwight D. Eisenhower. He believed that space exploration was crucial not only for scientific advancement but also for national security and the global influence of the United States. Through the National Aeronautics and Space Act, Eisenhower established NASA as a civilian entity, emphasizing the importance of a peaceful and collaborative approach to space exploration.<p>
                
                    </p>Under Eisenhower's leadership, NASA began to develop programs that focused not only on space exploration but also on aeronautical research. The goal was to utilize science and technology for the benefit of society, promoting education and the development of new technologies that could be applied in various fields.<p>
                
                    </p>The founding of NASA marked the beginning of a new era in space exploration, with the agency becoming a symbol of human potential and technological innovation, reflecting Eisenhower's vision for the future.</p></div>
