        <h1>History of NASA</h1>
        <div class="grid-container">
            <div class="item1"> <h1>Fundation</h1> <p>NASA, or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was founded on July 29, 1958, as a response by the United States to the Soviet advance in the space race, particularly after the launch of the Sputnik satellite in 1957. Its creation was driven by the desire to strengthen scientific and technological research in the fields of aeronautics and space exploration. NASA emerged from the merger of various existing organizations and programs, including NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics), and was tasked with leading U.S. space exploration initiatives. Since then, NASA has played a crucial role in space missions, including the famous Apollo mission that landed the first humans on the Moon in 1969, significantly contributing to advancements in science and technology.</p></div>
